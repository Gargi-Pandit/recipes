    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This omelette recipe is a staple in our kitchen, and my hope is that it will be in yours too. It’s hands down my favorite method for how to make an omelette. I love it because the results are fantastic (think fluffy, tender, just-set eggs), but it’s easy to master. With a little practice, you’ll be able to pull off a perfect omelette every time!</p>

    <p>Make one for a hearty breakfast, or whip one up for a quick and easy lunch or dinner. The beauty of this omelette recipe is that it’s a delicious option for any meal. Plus, you can stuff it with whatever you like. Go all out with seasonal veggies, or keep it simple with a filling of fresh herbs and cheese. Either way, I think you’ll love it!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ Tablespoon salted butter</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>Pinch salt and pepper</li>
        <li>¼ cup sharp cheddar cheese shredded</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk eggs vigorously until they are homogenous (uniform throughout). Whisk in salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in an 8” nonstick skillet over medium-low heat.</li>
        <li>Add whisked eggs and swirl the pan until they are evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Cover the pan and cook over medium-low heat until the eggs begin to set. Once they begin to set, use a spatula to gently push the edges in slightly and swirl the pan so that any uncooked eggs on the top pour over the sides to the edges of the pan and cook.</li>
        <li>Once the omelette is mostly set (about 5-6 minutes), carefully flip it and turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle cheese over the top of the omelette.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
